Sprint Retrospective

This was sprint 3 and the final sprint for us to implement our entire product backlog and user stories. Contrasting sprints 1 and 2, for this sprint we focused on making sure that our app was robust, meaning that it would not crash anywhere. We also made sure that everything was working as it should be, and we also focused more on the design of our app for this sprint, making a logo and changing the colors and designs within the xml files. Beside those design changes to our app which everybody worked on, we still had other user stories to implement, so each one of us had different responsibilities.

Farhana implemented much of universal leaderboard and challenge specific leaderboard, adding the corresponding activities to android and also updating the database accordingly. Farhana also did much of the design work, as she made the logo and inserted it in the appropriate places within the app. She also did research on espresso tests and created the first espresso test so that we could use hers as a template for us, as the rest of us did not know how to do espresso tests.

Adrienne continued doing research and implementing the notification system for users who have not logged their challenge for the day. She also implemented the option to see other users profiles, and made it robust to make sure the right information was being displayed for the right user type and privacy setting. She was also our documenter for this sprint, so she updated the scrum meetings.

Shradda implemented the delete and reset user buttons so that a user could delete their profile. She also made it so that users could rate challenges and store that information in the database. She was our manager for this sprint so she initiated our scrum meetings and made sure that everybody was accounted for and that everybody was on the same page.

I (Chris) added a few features to the app. I added the option to be able to change your profile picture and store that in the database, and so that other profiles could see your picture. I also added many recycler views to display large data from the database, for example searching for other users and viewing the challenges a coach has created. Towards the end of the sprint since we were limited on who could test the app with the emulator I tested every feature of our app and made sure that it was basically functional. Because of this emulator impediment I did run out of some time to test each feature extensively, but from what I tested the app does not crash anywhere.

Overall this sprint was a successful final sprint for us and we were able to complete most of our user stories in our product backlog. Our main goals this sprint was to make sure that we had a functional app and that it was demo and presentation ready for the client and the class.
