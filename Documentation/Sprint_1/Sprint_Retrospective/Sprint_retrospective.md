Project C Group 2 Team Reflection

The objective of our first sprint was to create a database and essentially connect all of the stakeholders to it. We focused mostly on the functionality of the coaches. Such as providing a create challenge page, and coach profile. We also focused on the users by creating a log in page. Many insights were made from our team during this sprint. There were learning curves with all of the components needed for the composition of this app. We continued to learn version control through GitHub, the basics of android studio, database functionality, and brushed up on the components of the JAVA programming language throughout the first sprint. Apart from technical insights, we learned more about managing time, and the importance of taking small steps to figure out a big problem. The team also learned how to work together and improved on communication and documentation of code.

Adrienne was in charge of making the user class, which includes enums of athletes and coach. This class also includes the variables and methods that each user needs such as user name and password. Adrienne also handled the forgot username and password classes as well as change username and password classes. These methods allow the user to change their usernames and passwords. Chris set up and connected the database to the application using SQLite. He also implemented the register and log in activities. The data base allows coaches, athletes, and challenges to be inputted into the database. Farhana created the challenge form activity class, and part of the search menu class for the challenges. The challenge form allows coaches to input challenges into the app. The search menu allows for all users to search through all of the challenges according to the challenge name. Shradda created the coach profile UI, the coach activity class, and part of the search challenge. The coach profile allows the coach to view their challenges, and to create a challenge.

Changes were made as we continued to work on the app, such as utilizing enums in the user class instead of inheritance, pushing the email validation to the next sprint, and removing past challenges lead class. One thing that worked during this sprint was phone calls for the meetings. Even if we were not all at the same place and could not meet up, we were all good to have quick updates through the phone. Another thing that worked during this sprint was the teamâ€™s ability to share what they were doing while/before they do it, so everyone has an idea of what is being done without confusion. Areas of improvement include utilizing GitHub more to update the progress for each user story in GitHub and focusing more on testing. For the next sprint, we strive to have all of the working parts ready to be tested a couple days before the sprint ends so we have time for proper testing and time to make change if needed. Overall, this sprint went smoothly for it being our first sprint.
