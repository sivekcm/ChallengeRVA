## Scrum Meetings
The team is to meet for 10 days during the two-week sprint - 5 meetings per week. You must decide on a time to record your answers to the questions and then a single commit of the day's responses is to be made into your project repository for that day.

| What did you complete since the last meeting? | Adrienne Serra | Update issues on project | Update issues on project | Completed Sprint 1 Class UML diagram for User objects and planned data structures to support methods | Created User object and methods or stubs |
|            | Chris Sivek | Set up repo with documentation and user stories | Thinking about class hierarchy for login | Made an ER diagram for the database | Made early version of login page |
|            | Shradda Adhikari | Assignment of issues to group members | Start to visualize structure and beginnings of challenge class, communicate with Farhana about starting | UML class diagram | created CreateChallenge and Coach classes |
|            | Farhana Khan | Added issues to the project dashboard | Focus on the creation of the challenge class -> identify the fields and the structure | UML class diagram | Created UserType and PastChallenges classes |
| What will you accomplish before the next meeting? | Adrienne Serra | Plan structure for user objects | Plan structure for user objects | Begin coding, establish method stubs and commentary | Research Git, database functionality, encryption, reconcile User object versions |
|            | Chris Sivek | Continue research on user accounts and storing info in database | Create a class diagram and start writing early versions of classes | Start connecting database code with android studio | Finish implementing the database with android |
|            | Shradda Adhikari | Look into the issues and decide which ones to do (split with Farhana) | Start some sort of organizational diagram | Start code for the challenge class | Continue to finish the methods |
|            | Farhana Khan | Look over assigned cards and plan/design algorithms to solve those issues | Get with Shradda again to discuss more about the organization of the challenge class, as we will be working on it together | Start on the code for coach object and see how to connect that to database (using Chrisâ€™s model) | Continue to look at the relationships between classes (inheritance, encapsulation, etc.) |
| Do you have anything that's getting in the way of doing your work? | Adrienne Serra | sleep or lack thereof and exams | sleep or lack thereof and exams | Work Monday evening | No |
|            | Chris Sivek | work and midterms | midterms and working Thursday and Friday | Free all week except Tuesday morning through afternoon | No |
|            | Shradda Adhikari | Exams tomorrow | busy until Friday | busy Monday | No |
|            | Farhana Khan | Midterm today :( | Busy end of the week | Monday will be unavailable during the day | No |
| What insights have you made? | Adrienne Serra | Structuring polymorphism in user objects | Structuring polymorphism in user objects | Arraylists to store references to Challenge and Team objects | Possible use of Enumeration for user type, different GUI for different user types prevents users from accessing invalid methods for their type |
|            | Chris Sivek | Learned a lot about relational databases | The user class may have subclasses for athletes and coaches | Using the database may be easier than I thought | Database may take a lot of code to write |
|            | Shradda Adhikari | Gained more understanding on how to organize the user stories we have into categories | Will take more planning than I thought | We need to make sure we code using the same variables | Becoming comfortable with git. |
|            | Farhana Khan | Understanding the structure of Sprint 1 with group | Feeling comfortable with the structure of the first sprint | Understand connections to database and to make sure all group members have the same understanding of the design | Being able to understand git flow and how the repo will (and should) be organized |
| Do any changes to the project need to be made as a result of your work? | Adrienne Serra | None yet | None yet | None | None |
|            | Chris Sivek | No changes yet | No changes yet | None yet | None |
|            | Shradda Adhikari | The issues we have for sprint one may be too much to do in the time that we have | None | None | None |
|            | Farhana Khan | May need to reorganize sprint 1 cards; seems like there is too much for the time duration we have for the sprint | None as of yet | Uhhh figure out app name!! | None |
