## Scrum Meetings
The team is to meet for 10 days during the two-week sprint - 5 meetings per week. You must decide on a time to record your answers to the questions and then a single commit of the day's responses is to be made into your project repository for that day.

Question    |          Person                                             | 2/27/2019 | 2/28/2019 | 3/4/2019 | 3/5/2019 | 3/6/2019 | 3/7/2019 | 3/8/2019 | 3/11/2018 | 3/13/2019 | 3/15/2019 |

| What will you accomplish before the next meeting? | Adrienne Serra | Plan structure for user objects | Plan structure for user objects | Begin coding, establish method stubs and commentary | Research Git, database functionality, encryption, reconcile User object versions | Login page GUI | Finish login UI, work on database functionality with User methods | Login/Forgot Password UI | Finish login UI, finish User object updates, work with MailGun for email functionality in forgot username/password | Create forgot password/username UI | implement Activity transitions |
|            | Chris Sivek | Continue research on user accounts and storing info in database | Create a class diagram and start writing early versions of classes | Start connecting database code with android studio | Finish implementing the database with android | Try to get database fully functioning | Finishing up methods and documentation from DBHelper plus signup page UI | implement the registerActivity so users can create accounts | add more DBHelper functionality | Finish login implementation | Create user objects when user logs in |
|            | Shradda Adhikari | Look into the issues and decide which ones to do (split with Farhana) | Start some sort of organizational diagram | Start code for the challenge class | Continue to finish the methods | Finish a backbone of the profile UI | add condition statements to methods and continue working on the UI | Hopefully finish coach profile UI | finish documentation of challenge class and connect coach UI with db | finish coach activity class | finish coach activity class, finish documentation, finish group reflection |
|            | Farhana Khan | Look over assigned cards and plan/design algorithms to solve those issues | Get with Shradda again to discuss more about the organization of the challenge class, as we will be working on it together | Start on the code for coach object and see how to connect that to database (using Chris’s model) | Continue to look at the relationships between classes (inheritance, encapsulation, etc.) | Complete the challenge form (may not complete UI by then) | Hopefully finish the UI & update documentation for classes pertaining to challenges work | Will have the connection to the DB connection to the challenge form | Finish up Challenge class and update UML diagrams and get rid of PastChallengesLed (different implementation of class’s algorithm) | Testing, debugging, making sure everything works, UML diagrams update | Completing Search Menu Activity |
| Do you have anything that's getting in the way of doing your work? | Adrienne Serra | sleep or lack thereof and exams | sleep or lack thereof and exams | Work Monday evening | No | No | Minor obligation | Work most of weekend | work, class, health issues | Classes | Work tonight and tomorrow night |
|            | Chris Sivek | work and midterms | midterms and working Thursday and Friday | Free all week except Tuesday morning through afternoon | No | No | run errands tomorrow morning | some errands to run tomorrow morning with my dad | Classes tomorrow | Work and test tomorrow | Work sunday morning so can’t stay up late on saturday |
|            | Shradda Adhikari | Exams tomorrow | busy until Friday | busy Monday | No | No | No | No | work tonight until 9 | Classes this week | none, things during the day tomorrow |
|            | Farhana Khan | Midterm today :( | Busy end of the week | Monday will be unavailable during the day | No | No | Not able to get emulator started up on personal laptop | No | Busy until 5pm most days, only have lab to do database work :( | Deadline for work at 4pm | Will be idle tomorrow - event prep all day |
| What insights have you made? | Adrienne Serra | Structuring polymorphism in user objects | Structuring polymorphism in user objects | Arraylists to store references to Challenge and Team objects | Possible use of Enumeration for user type, different GUI for different user types prevents users from accessing invalid methods for their type | Learned new information on Git | Android Studio is mean | Need to figure out how to make user objects from database | Addressed questions about DBHelper | May be able to pass in user objects as parameters into database using method | We should start connecting everything we have |
|            | Chris Sivek | Learned a lot about relational databases | The user class may have subclasses for athletes and coaches | Using the database may be easier than I thought | Database may take a lot of code to write | The Database is not being created for some reason | Method for accessing data may take some thinking | Registration implementation may take some time | Could add more convenience methods to DBHelper | We need to start connecting activities so you can access everything | I think we are in good standing for the end of this sprint |
|            | Shradda Adhikari | Gained more understanding on how to organize the user stories we have into categories | Will take more planning than I thought | We need to make sure we code using the same variables | Becoming comfortable with git. | More understanding of how to make UIs | Need to make methods more robust and catch more user errors | Need to start thinking of the CoachActivity and displaying challenges | Can use cursor objects instead of 2d array | Learned more about cursor objects | Picture not showing up, so need to research that |
|            | Farhana Khan | Understanding the structure of Sprint 1 with group | Feeling comfortable with the structure of the first sprint | Understand connections to database and to make sure all group members have the same understanding of the design | Being able to understand git flow and how the repo will (and should) be organized | connecting UIs to source code files  | Able to start using the database methods | Documentation is important | We need to make sure we all merge code correctly and make sure we all communicate with each other via github (adding documentation to code!) | Challenge form is almost done! | Searches and Queries with database |
| Do any changes to the project need to be made as a result of your work? | Adrienne Serra | None yet | None yet | None | None | None | None | No | No | No | None |
|            | Chris Sivek | No changes yet | No changes yet | None yet | None | None | Add robustness to existing methods in DBHelper | No | No | possible change to the way data is accessed. | Change what happens when user logs in |
|            | Shradda Adhikari | The issues we have for sprint one may be too much to do in the time that we have | None | None | None | None | None | No | fix up UML diagram | None | None |
|            | Farhana Khan | May need to reorganize sprint 1 cards; seems like there is too much for the time duration we have for the sprint | None as of yet | Uhhh figure out app name!! | None | None | No | No | UML diagrams -> talk to shradda about compiling a new draft of UML diagram | UML diagrams!!! | None |
